# Support

## Getting Help

Use GitHub Issues for:
- bug reports,
- feature requests,
- setup questions.

Please include:
- Windows version,
- run mode (`python main.py` or EXE),
- exact hotkeys used,
- redacted `app.log` snippets if relevant.

## Security Issues

Do not open public issues for vulnerabilities.

Use private security reporting as described in `SECURITY.md`.
